abstract={Diamond has established itself as an ideal material for photonics and optomechanics, due to its broad-band transparency and hardness. In addition, colour centres hosted within its lattice such as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre, have become leading candidates for use in quantum information processing, and quantum sensors. The fabrication of nanoscale devices coupled to high quality NVs has been an outstanding challenge due to their sensitivity to magnetic, electric and strain fields within their local environment. In this work, we show how the NV centre's ground state electron spin can be used as an embedded atomic-scale probe of the local strain caused by focused ion beam milling of nanoscale devices. This technique can thus be used to measure, and optimise material and device fabrication processes to allow diamond to reach its full potential.},

abstract={The development of hybrid quantum systems is central to the advancement of emerging quantum technologies, including quantum information science and quantum-assisted sensing. The recent demonstration of high-quality single-crystal diamond resonators has led to significant interest in a hybrid system consisting of nitrogen--vacancy centre spins that interact with the resonant phonon modes of a macroscopic mechanical resonator through crystal strain. However, the nitrogen--vacancy spin--strain interaction has not been well characterized. Here, we demonstrate dynamic, strain-mediated coupling of the mechanical motion of a diamond cantilever to the spin of an embedded nitrogen--vacancy centre. Via quantum control of the spin, we quantitatively characterize the axial and transverse strain sensitivities of the nitrogen--vacancy ground-state spin. The nitrogen--vacancy centre is an atomic scale sensor and we demonstrate spin-based strain imaging with a strain sensitivity of 3 {\texttimes} 10−6 strain Hz−1/2. Finally, we show how this spin-resonator system could enable coherent spin--phonon interactions in the quantum regime.},

We focus on two topics: scanning probe techniques with single NV centers and their application in the imaging of nanoscale magnetic structures, as well as recent development of magnetometers with ensembles of NV centers, which image magnetic fields at micron-length scales with extremely high sensitivities.},

abstract={Nanodiamonds containing fluorescent Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers are the smallest single particles, of which a magnetic resonance spectrum can be recorded at room temperature using optically-detected magnetic resonance (ODMR). By recording spectral shift or changes in relaxation rates, various physical and chemical quantities can be measured such as the magnetic field, orientation, temperature, radical concentration, pH or even NMR. This turns NV-nanodiamonds into nanoscale quantum sensors, which can be read out by a sensitive fluorescence microscope equipped with an additional magnetic resonance upgrade. In this review, we introduce the field of ODMR spectroscopy of NV-nanodiamonds and how it can be used to sense different quantities. Thereby we highlight both, the pioneering contributions and the latest results (covered until 2021) with a focus on biological applications.},

abstract={Modern quantum technologies rely crucially on techniques to mitigate quantum decoherence; these techniques can be either passive, achieved for example via materials engineering, or active, typically achieved via pulsed monochromatic driving fields applied to the qubit. Using a solid-state defect spin coupled to a microwave-driven spin bath, we experimentally demonstrate a decoherence mitigation method based on spectral engineering of the environmental noise with a polychromatic drive waveform, and show that it outperforms monochromatic techniques. Results are in agreement with quantitative modeling, and open the path to active decoherence protection using custom-designed waveforms applied to the environment rather than the qubit.},

abstract={We present theoretical proposals for two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy protocols based on Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond that are strongly coupled to the target nuclei. Continuous microwave and radio-frequency driving fields together with magnetic field gradients achieve Hartmann-Hahn resonances between NV spin sensor and selected nuclei for control of nuclear spins and subsequent measurement of their polarization dynamics. The strong coupling between the NV sensor and the nuclei facilitates coherence control of nuclear spins and relaxes the requirement of nuclear spin polarization to achieve strong signals and therefore reduced measurement times. Additionally, we employ a singular value thresholding matrix completion algorithm to further reduce the amount of data required to permit the identification of key features in the spectra of strongly sub-sampled data. We illustrate the potential of this combined approach by applying the protocol to a shallowly implanted NV center addressing a small amino acid, alanine, to target specific hydrogen nuclei and to identify the corresponding peaks in their spectra.},

abstract={Imaging the atomic structure of a single biomolecule is an important challenge in the physical biosciences. Whilst existing techniques all rely on averaging over large ensembles of molecules, the single-molecule realm remains unsolved. Here we present a protocol for 3D magnetic resonance imaging of a single molecule using a quantum spin probe acting simultaneously as the magnetic resonance sensor and source of magnetic field gradient. Signals corresponding to specific regions of the molecule's nuclear spin density are encoded on the quantum state of the probe, which is used to produce a 3D image of the molecular structure. Quantum simulations of the protocol applied to the rapamycin molecule (C51H79NO13) show that the hydrogen and carbon substructure can be imaged at the angstrom level using current spin-probe technology. With prospects for scaling to large molecules and/or fast dynamic conformation mapping using spin labels, this method provides a realistic pathway for single-molecule microscopy.},

Among the excitations, we observe the propagating dipolar and dipolar-exchange spinwaves, as well as dynamics associated with the multi-domain state of the ferromagnet at low fields.

Here we present a practical approach to meet this challenge, using magnetometry based on single nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond. We focus on spin-wave excitations in a ferromagnetic microdisc, and demonstrate local, quantitative and phase-sensitive detection of the spin-wave magnetic field at ∼50{\thinspace}nm from the disc. We map the magnetic-field dependence of spin-wave excitations by detecting the associated local reduction in the disc's longitudinal magnetization. In addition, we characterize the spin--noise spectrum by nitrogen-vacancy spin relaxometry, finding excellent agreement with a general analytical description of the stray fields produced by spin--spin correlations in a 2D magnetic system. These complementary measurement modalities pave the way towards imaging the local excitations of systems such as ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, skyrmions, atomically assembled quantum magnets, and spin ice.},

abstract={Magnetic skyrmions are two-dimensional non-collinear spin textures characterized by an integer topological number. Room-temperature skyrmions were recently found in magnetic multilayer stacks, where their stability was largely attributed to the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction. The strength of this interaction and its role in stabilizing the skyrmions is not yet well understood, and imaging of the full spin structure is needed to address this question. Here, we use a nitrogen-vacancy centre in diamond to measure a map of magnetic fields produced by a skyrmion in a magnetic multilayer under ambient conditions. We compute the manifold of candidate spin structures and select the physically meaningful solution. We find a N{\'e}el-type skyrmion whose chirality is not left-handed, contrary to preceding reports. We propose skyrmion tube-like structures whose chirality rotates through the film thickness. We show that NV magnetometry, combined with our analysis method, provides a unique tool to investigate this previously inaccessible phenomenon.},

journal={Nature Communications},

day={16},
volume={11},
number={1},
pages={5229},
abstract={Development of sensitive local probes of magnon dynamics is essential to further understand the physical processes that govern magnon generation, propagation, scattering, and relaxation. Quantum spin sensors like the NV center in diamond have long spin lifetimes and their relaxation can be used to sense magnetic field noise at gigahertz frequencies. Thus far, NV sensing of ferromagnetic dynamics has been constrained to the case where the NV spin is resonant with a magnon mode in the sample meaning that the NV frequency provides an upper bound to detection. In this work we demonstrate ensemble NV detection of spinwaves generated via a nonlinear instability process where spinwaves of nonzero wavevector are parametrically driven by a high amplitude microwave field. NV relaxation caused by these driven spinwaves can be divided into two regimes; one- and multi-magnon NV relaxometry. In the one-magnon NV relaxometry regime the driven spinwave frequency is below the NV frequencies. The driven spinwave undergoes four-magnon scattering resulting in an increase in the population of magnons which are frequency matched to the NVs. The dipole magnetic fields of the NV-resonant magnons couple to and relax nearby NV spins. The amplitude of the NV relaxation increases with the wavevector of the driven spinwave mode which we are able to vary up to 3 {\texttimes} 106{\thinspace}m−1, well into the part of the spinwave spectrum dominated by the exchange interaction. Increasing the strength of the applied magnetic field brings all spinwave modes to higher frequencies than the NV frequencies. We find that the NVs are relaxed by the driven spinwave instability despite the absence of any individual NV-resonant magnons, suggesting that multiple magnons participate in creating magnetic field noise below the ferromagnetic gap frequency which causes NV spin relaxation.},

abstract={Laboratory search of exotic interactions is crucial for exploring physics beyond the standard model. We report new experimental constraints on two exotic spin-dependent interactions at the micrometer scale based on ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. A thin layer of NV electronic spin ensembles is synthesized as the solid-state spin quantum sensor, and a lead sphere is taken as the interacting nucleon source. Our result establishes new bounds for two types of exotic spin interactions at the micrometer scale. For an exotic parity-odd spin- and velocity-dependent interaction, improved bounds are set within the force range from 5 to 500 $\mu$m. The upper limit of the corresponding coupling constant {\$}g{\_}A^eg{\_}V^N{\$} at 330 $\mu$m is more than 1000-fold more stringent than the previous constraint. For the P, T-violating scalar-pseudoscalar nucleon-electron interaction, improved constraints are established within the force range from 6 to 45 $\mu$m. The limit of the corresponding coupling constant {\$}g{\_}S^Ng{\_}P^e{\$} is improved by more than one order of magnitude at 30 $\mu$m. This work demonstrates that a solid-state NV ensemble can be a powerful platform for probing exotic spin-dependent interactions.},

abstract={Exotic interactions carried by unexplored bosons beyond the standard model may help explain the nature of dark matter. We propose a scalable quantum chip toward high-precision searches for exotic interactions. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposal, we experimentally implement an on-chip proof-of-principle spin-mechanical detector for low-mass dark matter. Furthermore, searching for exotic interactions becomes a challenge when the force range drops into the submicron scale due to the exponential decay of interaction strength with distance. Here, we solved this problem by fabricating a chip-scale detector with a single spin sensor close to a nucleon source?a micromechanical resonator. How to illuminate dark matter has become the foremost open question in fundamental science nowadays, which is of great significance in understanding the laws of nature. Exploring exotic interactions beyond the standard model is one of the essential approaches to searching for dark matter particles. Although it has been explored in a variety of lab-scale and tabletop-scale setups over the past years, no such interactions have been observed, and improving the sensitivity significantly becomes of paramount importance, but challenging. Here, we formulate the conception of a spin-mechanical quantum chip compatible with scalable on-chip detectors. Utilizing the prototype chip realized by the integration of a mechanical resonator and a diamond with single nitrogen vacancy at the microscale, the constraints of spin-velocity-dependent interactions have been improved by two orders of magnitude, where there is no evidence for new bosons in the force range below 100 nm, i.e., in the rest-mass window of 2?10 electronvolts. Based on the proof-of-principle experiment, this promising chip can be scaled up to meet the requirements of searching for exotic interactions at preeminent sensitivity. Low-cost and high-yield chip-scale setups will accelerate the process of dark matter exploration, providing a path toward on-chip fundamental physics experiments.},

abstract={Searching for new particles beyond the standard model is crucial for understanding several fundamental conundrums in physics and astrophysics. Several hypothetical particles can mediate exotic spin-dependent interactions between ordinary fermions, which enable laboratory searches via the detection of the interactions. Most laboratory searches utilize a macroscopic source and detector, thus allowing the detection of interactions with submillimeter force range and above. It remains a challenge to detect the interactions at shorter force ranges. Here we propose and demonstrate that a near-surface nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond can be utilized as a quantum sensor to detect the monopole--dipole interaction between an electron spin and nucleons.

abstract={Next-generation dark matter (DM) detectors searching for weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) will be sensitive to coherent scattering from solar neutrinos, demanding an efficient background-signal discrimination tool. Directional detectors improve sensitivity to WIMP DM despite the irreducible neutrino background. Wide-bandgap semiconductors offer a path to directional detection in a high-density target material. A detector of this type operates in a hybrid mode. The WIMP or neutrino-induced nuclear recoil is detected using real-time charge, phonon, or photon collection. The directional signal, however, is imprinted as a durable sub-micron damage track in the lattice structure. This directional signal can be read out by a variety of atomic physics techniques, from point defect quantum sensing to x-ray microscopy. In this Review, we present the detector principle as well as the status of the experimental techniques required for directional readout of nuclear recoil tracks. Specifically, we focus on diamond as a target material; it is both a leading platform for emerging quantum technologies and a promising component of next-generation semiconductor electronics. Based on the development and demonstration of directional readout in diamond over the next decade, a future WIMP detector will leverage or motivate advances in multiple disciplines toward precision dark matter and neutrino physics.},

abstract={Label-free detection of nucleic acids such as microRNAs holds great potential for early diagnostics of various types of cancers. Measuring intrinsic biomolecular charge using methods based on field effect has been a promising way to accomplish label-free detection. However, the charges of biomolecules are screened by counter ions in solutions over a short distance (Debye length), thereby limiting the sensitivity of these methods. Here, we measure the intrinsic magnetic noise of paramagnetic counter ions, such as Mn2+, interacting with microRNAs using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations show that microRNA interacts with the diamond surface resulting in excess accumulation of Mn ions and stronger magnetic noise. We confirm this prediction by observing an increase in spin relaxation contrast of the NV centers, indicating higher Mn2+ local concentration. This opens new possibilities for next-generation quantum sensing of charged biomolecules, overcoming limitations due to the Debye screening.},

abstract={Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy combined with site-directed spin labelling is applicable to biomolecules and their complexes irrespective of system size and in a broad range of environments. Neither short-range nor long-range order is required to obtain structural restraints on accessibility of sites to water or oxygen, on secondary structure, and on distances between sites. Many of the experiments characterize a static ensemble obtained by shock-freezing. Compared with characterizing the dynamic ensemble at ambient temperature, analysis is simplified and information loss due to overlapping timescales of measurement and system dynamics is avoided. The necessity for labelling leads to sparse restraint sets that require integration with data from other methodologies for building models. The double electron--electron resonance experiment provides distance distributions in the nanometre range that carry information not only on the mean conformation but also on the width of the native ensemble. The distribution widths are often inconsistent with Anfinsen's concept that a sequence encodes a single native conformation defined at atomic resolution under physiological conditions.},

DEER does not require crystallization and is not limited with respect to the size of the protein or protein complex. Diamagnetic proteins are accessible by site-directed spin labeling. To characterize structure or structural changes, experimental protocols were optimized and techniques for artifact suppression were introduced. Data analysis programs were developed, and it was realized that interpretation of the distance distributions must take into account the conformational distribution of spin labels. First methods have appeared for deriving structural models from a small number of distance constraints. The present scope and limitations of the technique are illustrated.",

Therefore, we introduce here the highly hydrophilic trityl spin label Ox-SLIM. Engineered as a short-linked maleimide, it combines the most recent developments in one single molecule, as it does not aggregate with proteins, exhibits high resistance under in-cell conditions, provides a short linker, and allows for selective and efficient spin labelling via cysteines. Beyond establishing synthetic access to Ox-SLIM, its suitability as a spin label is illustrated and ultimately, highly sensitive PDS measurements are presented down to protein concentrations as low as 45 nm resolving interspin distances of up to 5.5 nm.},

Previously we demonstrated that nitroxide labels combined with pulsed ESR spectroscopy is a promising tool for this purpose. However, the nitroxide labels suffer from poor stability, high background labeling, and low sensitivity. Here we show that Finland (FTAM) and OX063 based labels enable labeling of the cobalamin transporter BtuB and BamA, the central component of the β-barrel assembly machinery (BAM) complex, in E coli. Compared to the methanethiosulfonate spin label (MTSL), trityl labels eliminated the background signals and enabled specific in situ labeling of the proteins with high efficiency. The OX063 labels show a long phase memory time (TM) of ≈5 μs. All the trityls enabled distance measurements between BtuB and an orthogonally labeled substrate with high selectivity and sensitivity down to a few μm concentration. Our data corroborate the BtuB and BamA conformations in the cellular environment of E. coli.},

abstract = {Abstract Trityl radicals (TAMs) have recently appeared as an alternative source of spin labels for measuring long distances in biological systems. Finland trityl radical (FTAM) served as the basis for this new generation of spin labels, but FTAM is rather lipophilic and susceptible to self-aggregation, noncovalent binding with lipophilic sites of proteins, and noncovalent docking at the termini of duplex DNA. In this paper the very hydrophilic OX063 TAM with very low toxicity and little tendency for aggregation is used as the basis for a spin label. Human serum albumin (HSA) labeled with OX063 has an intense narrow line typical of TAM radicals in solution, whereas HSA labeled with FTAM shows broad lines and extensive aggregation. In pulse EPR measurements, the measured phase memory time TM for HSA labeled with OX063 is 6.3 μs at 50 K, the longest yet obtained with a TAM-based spin label. The lowered lipophilicity also decreases side products in the labeling reaction.},

ABSTRACT = {Pulsed dipolar electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (PDS) in combination with site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) of proteins and oligonucleotides is a powerful tool in structural biology. Instead of using the commonly employed gem-dimethyl-nitroxide labels, triarylmethyl (trityl) spin labels enable such studies at room temperature, within the cells and with single-frequency electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments. However, it has been repeatedly reported that labeling of proteins with trityl radicals led to low labeling efficiencies, unspecific labeling and label aggregation. Therefore, this work introduces the synthesis and characterization of a maleimide-functionalized trityl spin label and its corresponding labeling protocol for cysteine residues in proteins. The label is highly cysteine-selective, provides high labeling efficiencies and outperforms the previously employed methanethiosulfonate-functionalized trityl label. Finally, the new label is successfully tested in PDS measurements on a set of doubly labeled Yersinia outer protein O (YopO) mutants.},

ABSTRACT = {The three-dimensional structure of protein is determined by analyzing diffraction data collected using X-ray beams. However, X-ray beam can damage protein crystals during data collection, lowering the quality of the crystal data. A way to prevent such damage is by treating protein crystals with cryoprotectants. The cryoprotectant stabilizes the protein crystal and prevents lowering the quality of the diffraction data. Many kinds of cryoprotectants are commercially available, and various treatment methods have also been reported. However, incorrect selection or treatment of such cryoprotectants may lead to deterioration of crystal diffraction data when using X-ray beams.},

abstract = {Pulsed dipolar ESR spectroscopy, DEER and DQC, require frozen samples. An important issue in the biological application of this technique is how the freezing rate and concentration of cryoprotectant could possibly affect the conformation of biomacromolecule and/or spin-label. We studied in detail the effect of these experimental variables on the distance distributions obtained by DEER from a series of doubly spin-labeled T4 lysozyme mutants. We found that the rate of sample freezing affects mainly the ensemble of spin-label rotamers, but the distance maxima remain essentially unchanged. This suggests that proteins frozen in a regular manner in liquid nitrogen faithfully maintain the distance-dependent structural properties in solution. We compared the results from rapidly freeze-quenched (⩽100μs) samples to those from commonly shock-frozen (slow freeze, 1s or longer) samples. For all the mutants studied we obtained inter-spin distance distributions, which were broader for rapidly frozen samples than for slowly frozen ones. We infer that rapid freezing trapped a larger ensemble of spin label rotamers; whereas, on the time-scale of slower freezing the protein and spin-label achieve a population showing fewer low-energy conformers. We used glycerol as a cryoprotectant in concentrations of 10% and 30% by weight. With 10% glycerol and slow freezing, we observed an increased slope of background signals, which in DEER is related to increased local spin concentration, in this case due to insufficient solvent vitrification, and therefore protein aggregation. This effect was considerably suppressed in slowly frozen samples containing 30% glycerol and rapidly frozen samples containing 10% glycerol. The assignment of bimodal distributions to tether rotamers as opposed to protein conformations is aided by comparing results using MTSL and 4-Bromo MTSL spin-labels. The latter usually produce narrower distance distributions.}

abstract={High-field W-band electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was utilized to study the temperature dependence of the magnetic interaction parameters (g-, hyperfine-, quadrupole tensors) of two types of doublet-state nitroxide spin probes in glass-forming ortho-terphenyl solution: a five-membered ring system of pyrroline type (model for the commonly used methane thiosulfonate spin label) and a six-membered ring system of piperidine type (model for the commonly used TOAC spin label). The analysis of the g- and hyperfine tensors in terms of their isotropic and anisotropic parts reveals at least two mechanisms of motion that are responsible for the temperature dependence of the interaction parameters. The first mechanism is attributed to the overall small-angle motion of the nitroxide molecule in the glassy matrix; it leads to an averaging of the anisotropies of the EPR parameters. The second mechanism originates in an intramolecular out-of-plane motion of oxygen in the nitroxide group. This type of motion is evidenced by comparing the experimental findings for the spin-interaction parameters with the results of density functional theory calculations. The harmonic oxygen out-of-plane vibrations result in a variation of both the isotropic and anisotropic parts of the g- and hyperfine tensors. In contrast, the quadrupole tensor is not influenced by this vibration mechanism in the temperature range under study (90--240 K). Consequences of the applicability of such typical nitroxide radicals for probing details of their protein environment and for studying librational dynamics in frozen solutions are discussed.},

abstract={Spins in solid-state systems such as quantum dots and defect centers in diamond can easily be controlled by light for use in quantum information processing. More challenging is tuning their properties and making large arrays, something that can be done more easily with spins in molecules. Bayliss et al. combined the advantages of the two approaches by designing and characterizing three related molecular species that are optically addressable. The molecules consist of a central chromium ion surrounded by organic ligands, and their spin and optical properties can be tailored by simply changing the positions of methyl groups on the ligands. Science, this issue p. 1309 Three organometallic molecules that can be controlled by light are designed and characterized. Spin-bearing molecules are promising building blocks for quantum technologies as they can be chemically tuned, assembled into scalable arrays, and readily incorporated into diverse device architectures. In molecular systems, optically addressing ground-state spins would enable a wide range of applications in quantum information science, as has been demonstrated for solid-state defects. However, this important functionality has remained elusive for molecules. Here, we demonstrate such optical addressability in a series of synthesized organometallic, chromium(IV) molecules. These compounds display a ground-state spin that can be initialized and read out using light and coherently manipulated with microwaves. In addition, through atomistic modification of the molecular structure, we vary the spin and optical properties of these compounds, indicating promise for designer quantum systems synthesized from the bottom-up.},

Bringing high-efficiency DNP to the nanometer scale would open exciting avenues for studying nanoscale nuclear spin ensembles, such as single biomolecules, virus particles, and condensed matter systems. Combining pulsed DNP with nanoscale force-detected magnetic resonance measurements, we demonstrated a 100-fold enhancement in the Boltzmann polarization of proton spins in nanoscale sugar droplets at 6 kelvin and 0.33 tesla. Crucially, this enhancement corresponds to a factor of 200 reduction in the averaging time compared to measurements that rely on the detection of statistical fluctuations in nanoscale nuclear spin ensembles. These results substantially advance the capabilities of force-detected magnetic resonance detection as a practical tool for nanoscale imaging. Using pulsed DNP, a substantial 15-fold boost in nanoscale nuclear spin detection sensitivity is demonstrated.}}

When realized on the atomic scale, NMRd would be a powerful tool to study the structure of materials, utilizing the spectroscopic capabilities of NMR. The main challenge to achieving this goal lies in the ability to encode large relative phase differences between neighboring nuclear spins on the atomic scale. Utilizing key advances in nanoMRI technology, we demonstrate the ability to encode and detect angstrom-scale modulation of approximately 2 million 31P spins in an indium-phosphide (InP) nanowire with subangstrom precision. The work represents a significant step toward the realization of atomic-scale NMRd. We have combined ultrasensitive force-based spin detection with high-fidelity spin control to achieve NMR diffraction (NMRd) measurement of ~2 million 31P spins in a (50\&nbsp;nm)3 volume of an indium-phosphide (InP) nanowire. NMRd is a technique originally proposed for studying the structure of periodic arrangements of spins, with complete access to the spectroscopic capabilities of NMR. We describe two experiments that realize NMRd detection with subangstrom precision. In the first experiment, we encode a nanometer-scale spatial modulation of the z-axis magnetization of 31P spins and detect the period and position of the modulation with a precision of \&lt;0.8 Å. In the second experiment, we demonstrate an interferometric technique, utilizing NMRd, to detect an angstrom-scale displacement of the InP sample with a precision of 0.07 Å. The diffraction-based techniques developed in this work extend the Fourier-encoding capabilities of NMR to the angstrom scale and demonstrate the potential of NMRd as a tool for probing the structure and dynamics of nanocrystalline materials.}}

ABSTRACT = {Antifreeze proteins (AFPs) protect organisms living in subzero environments from freezing injury, which render them potential applications for cryopreservation of living cells, organs, and tissues. Cryoprotective agents (CPAs), such as glycerol and propylene glycol, have been used as ingredients to treat cellular tissues and organs to prevent ice crystal’s formation at low temperatures. To assess AFP’s function in CPA solutions, we have the applied site-directed spin labeling technique to a Type I AFP. A two-step process to prevent bulk freezing of the CPA solutions was observed by the cryo-photo microscopy, i.e., (1) thermodynamic freezing point depression by the CPAs; and (2) inhibition to the growth of seed ice crystals by the AFP. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments were also carried out from room temperature to 97 K, and vice versa. The EPR results indicate that the spin labeled AFP bound to ice surfaces, and inhibit the growths of ice through the bulk freezing processes in the CPA solutions. The ice-surface bound AFP in the frozen matrices could also prevent the formation of large ice crystals during the melting processes of the solutions. Our study illustrates that AFPs can play an active role in CPA solutions for cryopreservation applications.},

abstract  ="Some organisms can survive complete dehydration and high temperatures by adopting an anhydrobiotic state in which the intracellular medium contains large amounts of disaccharides{,} particularly trehalose and sucrose. Trehalose is most effective also in protecting isolated in vitro biostructures. In an attempt to clarify the molecular mechanisms of disaccharide bioprotection{,} we compared the structure and dynamics of sucrose and trehalose matrices at different hydration levels by means of high-field W-band EPR and FTIR spectroscopy. The hydration state of the samples was characterized by FTIR spectroscopy and the structural organization was probed by EPR using a nitroxide radical dissolved in the respective matrices. Analysis of the EPR spectra showed that the structure and dynamics of the dehydrated matrices as well as their evolution upon re-hydration differ substantially between trehalose and sucrose. The dehydrated trehalose matrix is homogeneous in terms of distribution of the residual water and spin-probe molecules. In contrast{,} dehydrated sucrose forms a heterogeneous matrix. It is comprised of sucrose polycrystalline clusters and several bulk water domains. The amorphous form was found only in 30% (volume) of the sucrose matrix. Re-hydration leads to a structural homogenization of the sucrose matrix{,} whilst in the trehalose matrix several domains develop differing in the local water/radical content and radical mobility. The molecular model of the matrices provides an explanation for the different protein–matrix dynamical coupling observed in dried ternary sucrose and trehalose matrices{,} and accounts for the superior efficacy of trehalose as a bioprotectant. Furthermore{,} for bacterial photosynthetic reaction centers it is shown that at low water content the protein–matrix coupling is modulated by the sugar/protein molar ratio in sucrose matrices only. This effect is suggested to be related to the preference for sucrose{,} rather than trehalose{,} as a bioprotective disaccharide in some anhydrobiotic organisms."}

Sequences are introduced for spectroscopy and imaging by proper choice of a phase alternating scheme. Using a 16 pulse time-suspension magic-echo cycle, the highest level of line-narrowing achieved was 2.7Hz for the [100] direction of a single crystal of calcium fluoride, a reduction in linewidth by 4 orders of magnitude.}

abstract={The detection of weak magnetic fields with high spatial resolution is an important problem in diverse areas ranging from fundamental physics and material science to data storage and biomedical science. Here, we explore a novel approach to the detection of weak magnetic fields that takes advantage of recently developed techniques for the coherent control of solid-state electron spin quantum bits. Specifically, we investigate a magnetic sensor based on nitrogen-vacancy centres in room-temperature diamond. We discuss two important applications of this technique: a nanoscale magnetometer that could potentially detect precession of single nuclear spins and an optical magnetic-field imager combining spatial resolution ranging from micrometres to millimetres with a sensitivity approaching a few fT{\thinspace}Hz−1/2.},

abstract={Spin complexes comprising the nitrogen-vacancy centre and neighbouring spins are being considered as a building block for a new generation of spintronic and quantum information processing devices. As assembling identical spin clusters is difficult, new strategies are being developed to determine individual node structures with the highest precision. Here we use a pulse protocol to monitor the time evolution of the 13C ensemble in the vicinity of a nitrogen-vacancy centre. We observe long-lived time correlations in the nuclear spin dynamics, limited by nitrogen-vacancy spin--lattice relaxation. We use the host 14N spin as a quantum register and demonstrate that hyperfine-shifted resonances can be separated upon proper nitrogen-vacancy initialization. Intriguingly, we find that the amplitude of the correlation signal exhibits a sharp dependence on the applied magnetic field. We discuss this observation in the context of the quantum-to-classical transition proposed recently to explain the field dependence of the spin cluster dynamics.},

abstract={Quantum sensors' responsiveness to their physical environment enables detection of variables such as temperature (T), pressure (P), and strain. We present a molecular platform for PT sensing using para-terphenyl crystals doped with pentacene (PDP), leveraging optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) of photoexcited triplet electron spins. We observe maximal frequency variations of df/dP=1.8 MHz/bar from 0-8 bar and df/dT=247 kHz/K from 79--330 K, over 1200 times and threefold greater, respectively, than those seen with nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond and >{\thinspace}85-fold greater pressure sensitivity over the previous record. Density functional theory calculations indicate picometer-level PT-induced molecular orbital shifts are measurable via ODMR. PDP offers additional advantages including high sensor doping levels, narrow ODMR linewidths, high contrast, and low-cost single crystal growth. Overall, this work reports low-cost, optically-interrogated PT sensors and lays the foundation for increased versatility of quantum sensors through synthetic molecular design.},

abstract={Spins are prototypical systems with the potential to probe magnetic fields down to the atomic scale limit. Exploiting their quantum nature through appropriate sensing protocols allows to enlarge their applicability to fields not always accessible by classical sensors. Here we first show that quantum sensing protocols for AC magnetic fields can be implemented with molecular spin ensembles embedded into hybrid quantum circuits. We then show that, using only echo detection at microwave frequency and no optical readout, Dynamical Decoupling protocols synchronized with the AC magnetic fields can enhance sensitivity up to S{\thinspace}≈{\thinspace}10−10{\thinspace}−{\thinspace}10−9{\thinspace}T{\thinspace}Hz−1/2 with a low (4-5) number of applied pulses.

Quantum chemical calculations using density functional theory predict a structure that reproduces the experimentally determined hyperfine tensors. The radicals are propeller-shaped with the three aryl rings nearly mutually orthogonal. The central carbon atom carrying most of the unpaired electron spin density is surrounded by the sulfur atoms in the radical and is completely shielded from solvent. This structure explains features of the electron spin relaxation of these radicals and suggests ways in which the radicals can be chemically modified to improve their characteristics for imaging and oximetry.}
